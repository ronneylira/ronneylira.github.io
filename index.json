Today, we\u0026rsquo;re diving into the world of Azure AD\u0026rsquo;s authentication system, which can make switching between development and production modes a breeze.\nMuch of this code can readily be found online in documentation and code samples. Because these solutions often \u0026lsquo;just work,\u0026rsquo; it\u0026rsquo;s tempting to fall into the trap of not exploring further to see how they can be enhanced.\nOne of the areas where you can quickly gain traction through online research is setting up Azure services like Key Vault and App Configuration. Typically, you would come across the following configuration:\nusing Azure.Identity; var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); if (builder.Environment.IsProduction()) { builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVault( new Uri($\u0026#34;https://{builder.Configuration[\u0026#34;KeyVaultName\u0026#34;]}.vault.azure.net/\u0026#34;), new DefaultAzureCredential()); } Now, this is how long the service will take for your service to startup while using the DefaultAzureCredential the DefaultAzureCredential is like your trusty friend, trying out different ways to get you logged in, step by step:\nEnvironmentCredential WorkloadIdentityCredential ManagedIdentityCredential SharedTokenCacheCredential VisualStudioCredential VisualStudioCodeCredential AzureCliCredential AzurePowerShellCredential AzureDeveloperCliCredential InteractiveBrowserCredential But here\u0026rsquo;s the fun part: when you\u0026rsquo;re in development mode (imagine using Azure CLI), it goes through a bit of a treasure hunt, trying out six different methods before it gets there.\nNow, here\u0026rsquo;s where you get to be in charge! Think of it as creating your own playlist of favorite songs. That\u0026rsquo;s what the ChainedTokenCredential lets you do. Check this out:\nusing Azure.Identity; var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); if (builder.Environment.IsProduction()) { builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVault( new Uri($\u0026#34;https://{builder.Configuration[\u0026#34;KeyVaultName\u0026#34;]}.vault.azure.net/\u0026#34;), new ChainedTokenCredential(new AzureCliCredential(), new DefaultAzureCredential())); } In this setup, we give the Azure CLI credential the spotlight first, and then the other methods follow suit. You can customize it to your heart\u0026rsquo;s content, maybe put ManagedIdentityCredential in the lead (because it\u0026rsquo;s the star in production) or mix things up for different situations. The result? Your project starts up almost a third faster! So there you have it â€“ a friendly tip to make your development journey smoother and more efficient.

I cannot recommend enough the great article from Scott Hanselman that teaches you how to unlock most of the potential within Windows Terminal, really making it your own.\nOnce you get used to working with the terminal is pretty hard to go back, the speed at which you are used to writing the commands and your own shortcuts make it a flow-like experience to daily work.\nA few of the things that can help you with your daily work are git shortcuts\n#git shortcuts Git shortcuts are just another name for the git configuration file, this being a global git config setup that essentially dictates how git should behave on your dev box.\nthe only thing you need to get started is to open your terminal and type in a command like this one\ngit config --global alias.co checkout this will append a configuration setting in your .git config file and will allow you to replace the ol'\ngit checkout BRANCH_NAME for a simpler\ngit co BRANCH_NAME that might seem small, but you are saving 6 characters multiple times a day. Measure that in a year, or even your professional life.\nlikewise, other commands can be simplified. Here is a list of the ones I use:\nto create a branch git config --global alias.br branch to commit git config --global alias.ci commit to review your current status git config --global alias.st status to check the last commit git config --global alias.last \u0026#39;log -1 HEAD\u0026#39; to cherry-pick a commit\ngit config --global alias.cp cherry-pick if you also unlock the power of WSL you can extend git (and Windows for that matter) with the help of Linux commands and applications in one seamless shortcut:\nto prune and delete old local branches git config --global alias.purge \u0026#39;!git fetch -p \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git branch -vv | awk \u0026#34;/: gone]/{print \\$1}\u0026#34; | xargs git branch -d\u0026#39; with the help of this shortcut\ngit prune you automatically fetch and prune remote branches, list them, send it to Linux\u0026rsquo;s awk to filter out only the pruned ones, and then feed those to the delete command.\njust make sure that you have git, wsl, and a distro with awk installed in your box to make use of this shortcut.\nfor today that\u0026rsquo;s it. thanks for reading.\n","permalink":"https://ronneylira.com/posts/git-shortcuts/","summary":"In this article, I\u0026rsquo;m going to cover handy shortcuts that can make your life in using git in the terminal faster and more convenient.\nI really love using Windows Terminal, it allows you to use any type of shell that you want, customize it, and extend it to the limit of your own imagination.
